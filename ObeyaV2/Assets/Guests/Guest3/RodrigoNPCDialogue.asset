  aswangResponses:
  - What do I know about aswangs?
  - They are not just the stories told to frighten children.
  - They are the shadows lurking at the edges of every village, the whispers in the
    dark that make your skin crawl.
  - People say they can shape-shift, that they can take on any form to lure their
    prey.
  - They hide among us, masked by human faces.
  eclipseResponses:
  - 'There is something unsettling about this darkness. '
  - 'Quite an unshakeable feeling that something is waiting... '
  - Something watching...
  - It seeps into your bones, makes you question what lurks just out of sight.
  - You feel it don't you?
  killDialogues:
  - I WILL KILL YOU-

  hearOutDialogues1:
  - I have long limbs, yes.
  - But do not be deceived by appearances alone.
  - "I know, I know\u2014people think I look like something out of a horror story."
  - "That\u2019s why I told you\u2014I have been outcast by our people too, all because
    of my appearance."
  - It is called 'Marfan syndrome'. I have had it since I was a kid. It makes me
    taller and gives me these long limbs.
  hearOutDialogues2:
  - I have not slept for days.
  - I apologize if my eyes look suspicious.
  hearOutDialogues3:
  - You have seen my teeth.
  - It is up to you to judge.
  hearOutDialogues4:
  - Smiling is not a reliable way to distinguish an Aswang to a Human.
  - You are quite paranoid, yes?
  - I understand the caution.
  dialoguesNight1:
  - "You didn\u2019t have to help me, but you did."
  - " I\u2019ll remember that."
  dialoguesNight2:
  - "They\u2019re out there."
  - Watching, waiting. I can feel it.
  dialoguesNight3:
  - "Do you think there\u2019s a way to stop them?"
  - Or are we all just delaying the inevitable?
  dialoguesNight4:
  - "They\u2019re inside my head."
  - "Their whispers... they\u2019re getting louder."
  dialoguesNight5: []
  introductoryDialogue:
  - "Good evening. I hope you don\u2019t mind me intruding. It\u2019s rare to find
    someone wandering these dark paths, especially so late."
  option1Responses:
  - You want to know my name?
  - It is Rodrigo
  - "I hail from a small settlement, once welcoming\u2026 until they turned their
    backs on me."
  - They said I was cursed, an outcast. I only wanted a place to call home, but darkness
    has a way of following me.

  option2Responses:
  - "What brings me here? I\u2019m searching for refuge, a shelter away from prying
    eyes and whispered fears."
  option2_1Responses:
  - Alone? It is a lonely existence, that is for sure. But in this darkness, it is
    often better to be isolated.
