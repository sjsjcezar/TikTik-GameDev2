  - Well, for sure, Tik-tiks are terrified of garlic.
  - "They say they can transform into anyone, even those you trust\u2014people you
    know!"
  - " Imagine seeing a familiar face, only to realize it\u2019s hiding a sinister
    secret behind a smile."
  - "Just keep an eye out. The stories may seem far-fetched, but there\u2019s always
    a grain of truth in them."
  - " It\u2019s best to stay indoors, where the shadows can\u2019t reach you."
  - You can never be too careful when the night holds its breath, ready to swallow
    you whole.
  eclipseResponses:
  - "It\u2019s happening right now. The sun hasn\u2019t dared to shine for days,
    and the darkness is creeping in."
  - The air thick with fear, suffocating like a damp cloth over your mouth.
  - "Everyone\u2019s on edge. Some say they\u2019ve heard strange noises in the dark,
    like voices calling for help."
  - Last night, I stepped outside, and that chill? It seeped into my bones.
  - ' I swear, I saw something slithering in the shadows, a flicker of movement that
    sent my heart racing.'
  - "Stick close to the light. It\u2019s the only sanctuary we have in this never-ending
    night."
  - Trust me, when the sun vanishes, so do the rules of our world

  hearOutDialogues3:
  - Well what do you think?

  introductoryDialogue:
  - Well, well, what do we have here?
  - A welcoming face in this endless sea of darkness.
  - "Ah, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not here to cause any trouble."
  - "I\u2019m just a wanderer looking for a bit of light in all this gloom."
  - May I have the honor of crossing your threshold?
  - "I promise I\u2019m more charming than I look!"
  - "Trust me, the world\u2019s a cold place out there. "
  - "But hey, I\u2019m one of the good guys, or at least, I try to be."
  - So, what do you say? Room for one more in this bastion of hope?
  option1Responses:
  - Ah, a fine question to start with!
  - "I\u2019m Amnah, at your service!"
  - You know, I used to think names were just labels, nothing more than sounds we
    answered to.
  - But lately, with all this eternal darkness around, I see them as something more.
  - A name is like a little spark, a flicker of light that refuses to go out, even
    when the shadows try to snuff it out.
  - "It\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019re still here, still fighting, still hoping
    for a brighter day, even when it seems so far away."
  - So, Amnah it is! A spark that keeps on glowing, no matter how dark the night.
  option1_1Responses:
  - Where am I from, you ask?
  - "Ah, that\u2019s a story in itself! I hail from a small village, nestled between
    emerald hills and shimmering rice fields."
  - You see, life there is simple yet beautiful.
  - The sun rises with a promise of warmth, and the evenings are filled with laughter
    from the locals sharing tales under the stars.
  - "But don\u2019t let the serenity fool you! It\u2019s a place where everyone knows
    each other, and the community holds strong, even when the shadows loom around
    us."
  - "It\u2019s not easy, though\u2014darkness has its way of creeping in, but we
    fight it with every smile and every meal shared together."
  option2Responses:
  - What brings me here? Well, I heard whispers of a sanctuary amid the shadows,
    a place where light still flickers against the eternal darkness.
  - Those whispers led me here, to your place.
  - Please tell me those whispers were right, that this place is a sanctuary from
    the dangers of the changed world.
  option2_1Responses:
  - Am I alone? Perhaps in body, but my spirit carries the voices of my village,
    and I know I'm never truly alone in this fight.
  - Their whispers are my armor and sword.
  - In this cursed darkness, their light guides my steps.
