  - "I\u2019ve heard so many stories of the aswangs, haven\u2019t you? People love
    a good tale about something they can\u2019t understand."
  - One popular theory among the folks is it's all just big misunderstanding.
  - Crazy, I know. The point was...
  - "...It\u2019s so easy to paint them as monsters, but what if they\u2019re just...
    misunderstood souls, doing what they must to survive?"
  - Some say they only hunt those who truly deserve it.
  - "Now, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s an interesting thought?"
  - "The idea that only certain people\u2014those with darkness in their hearts\u2014become
    prey..."
  - "Makes you wonder who gets to decide who\u2019s worthy of such a fate."
  - "Do you think that\u2019s true?"
  - That some are more deserving of being hunted than others?
  - "It\u2019s just a theory, of course. But who\u2019s to say?"
  - "The question of morality... it\u2019s so... flexible, don\u2019t you think?"
  - "What\u2019s right for one person is so different for another."
  - What one sees as justice, someone else might call cruelty.
  - "It\u2019s all a matter of perspective... and need, perhaps?"
  - This is quite thought provoking, darling.
  - But of course, we must stay away from the aswangs, after all.
  - "Such terrible creatures, aren\u2019t they?"
  eclipseResponses:
  - Oh, that sounds so ominous.
  - But you know what they say.
  - The darkest nights bring people closer together.
  - "Maybe it\u2019s not something to fear. Maybe it\u2019s something to embrace."
  - "Though, if you\u2019re scared I could keep you company."

  introductoryDialogue:
  - Oh my, such a gentleman... leaving a lady out here all alone?
  - It's so dark, and those awful creatures are everywhere.
  - "Won't you let me in? I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while."
  - Or... are you scared of little old me?
  option1Responses:
  - "My name is Selene, but you can just call me \"darling.\" Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m
    harmless."
  - "Though, letting me in might be the most thrilling risk you\u2019ve ever taken."
  - "And really, wouldn\u2019t you rather know me inside where it\u2019s safe?"
  - Would you rather I tell you my life story... or let me escape the monsters out
    there?
  - "Don\u2019t make me beg."
  option1_1Responses:
  - "A place far from here, but that\u2019s not important now, is it?"
  - "What matters is that I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re my savior."
  - Would you rather I tell you my life story... or let me escape the monsters out
    there?
  - "Don\u2019t make me beg."
  option2Responses:
  - "Oh, darling... you don\u2019t have to trust me."
  - "Trust is such a fragile thing, isn\u2019t it?"
  - Easily broken... or misplaced.
  - But I suppose, if you need a reason...
  - "I\u2019m standing here, outside your door."
  - Not rushing in, not forcing myself in.
  - "I\u2019m giving you the choice."
  - Does that not show you a little bit of trust in return?
  - "But then again, maybe I don\u2019t need your trust."
  - "Perhaps it\u2019s you who should be asking yourself, why wouldn\u2019t you trust
    someone who offers you a chance at... something more?"
  - "And that\u2019s all that truly matters."
  option2_1Responses:
  - Danger?
  - I suppose I do handle myself well under pressure.
  - "It\u2019s all about knowing how to play your cards, isn\u2019t it?"
  - "But trust me, darling, I\u2019d feel so much safer with you."
  - "After all, strength is always more... reassuring when shared, wouldn\u2019t
    you agree?"
  - Sometimes, keeping calm is the best survival skill.
  - "People panic, and that\u2019s when they make mistakes."
  - "People panic, and that\u2019s when they make mistakes."
  - "Sometimes, keeping calm is the best survival skill. Don\u2019t you agree?"
  - "Or maybe I just know I\u2019m exactly where I need to be."
