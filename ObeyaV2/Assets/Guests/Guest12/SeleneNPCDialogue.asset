  aswangResponses:
  - "Such terrible creatures... but fascinating, don\u2019t you think?"
  - So misunderstood.
  - Some say they only hunt those who truly deserve it.
  - "Do you think that\u2019s true?"
  - "But enough about them. Let\u2019s talk about something more pleasant... like
    us."
  eclipseResponses:
  - Oh, that sounds so ominous.
  - But you know what they say.
  - The darkest nights bring people closer together.
  - "Maybe it\u2019s not something to fear. Maybe it\u2019s something to embrace."
  - "Though, if you\u2019re scared I could keep you company."

  introductoryDialogue:
  - Oh my, such a gentleman... leaving a lady out here all alone?
  - It's so dark, and those awful creatures are everywhere.
  - "Won't you let me in? I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while."
  - Or... are you scared of little old me?
  option1Responses:
  - "My name is Selene, but you can just call me \"darling.\" Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m
    harmless."
  - "Though, letting me in might be the most thrilling risk you\u2019ve ever taken."
  - "And really, wouldn\u2019t you rather know me inside where it\u2019s safe?"

  - "A place far from here, but that\u2019s not important now, is it?"
  - "What matters is that I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re my savior."
  - Would you rather I tell you my life story... or let me escape the monsters out
    there?
  - "Don\u2019t make me beg, though I can if you like."
  option2Responses:
  - Oh, come on now. Do I look dangerous to you?
  - "I\u2019m just a helpless woman looking for a strong, brave protector."
  - "If I wanted to hurt you, wouldn\u2019t I have done it already?"
  - "But maybe... I should be asking you if you\u2019re dangerous."
  option2_1Responses:
  - Danger?
  - I suppose I do handle myself well under pressure.
  - "But trust me, I\u2019d feel so much safer with you."
  - "Sometimes, keeping calm is the best survival skill. Don\u2019t you agree?"
  - "Or maybe I just know I\u2019m exactly where I need to be."
