  aswangResponses:
  - Ah, the aswangs... fascinating beings from folklore, a blend of myth and reality.
  - Tales of their transformative abilities and nocturnal habits abound, though I
    suspect much of it stems from misunderstandings of the natural world.
  - Still, I cannot dismiss the possibility of truths hidden in such stories.
  eclipseResponses:
  - The Eternal Darkness is not simply a phenomenon; it is a force of will.
  - It consumes light and sows despair, unraveling the natural order.
  - "I suspect it is connected to ancient rites\u2014forgotten for good reason."
  - If my theories hold, this is no accident but a deliberate act.

  - "Good evening\u2014though I use the term loosely, given the state of the world."
  - I am in need of shelter.
  - The streets are far from safe, and I assure you, I am no threat to you.
  - May I come in?
  option1Responses:
  - My name is Miguel.
  - A scientist, or perhaps a scholar, though the line between the two blurs.
  - "I seek to understand the unknown\u2014and perhaps, in some small way, to shed
    light upon it."
  - "Now, if you\u2019ll permit me, survival must take precedence over introductions."
  option1_1Responses:
  - "I hail from the Clockwork Bastion\u2014a city of innovation."
  - Though it seems even our brightest minds failed to predict this calamity.
  - Now, the halls of reason echo with silence... and screams.
  option2Responses:
  - A fair question.
  - I carry no weapon and lack the strength to do harm even if I wished to.
  - "More importantly, I offer knowledge\u2014knowledge that may keep you alive."
  - If you turn me away, I fear we both lose something precious.
  option2_1Responses:
  - Only fragments.
  - "This phenomenon is not natural\u2014it feels orchestrated, controlled."
  - If you allow me inside, I may share what I know in greater detail.
  - But we are wasting precious moments, and time is not our ally.
