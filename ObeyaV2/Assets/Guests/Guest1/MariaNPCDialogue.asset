  aswangResponses:
  - " I don\u2019t know that much\u2026"
  - Just that it came out of nowhere.
  - One moment, everything was normal, and then it was like the world flipped.
  - Shadows creeping in, and then the monsters...
  - They took my family.
  - I barely escaped.
  eclipseResponses:
  - "Just went dark all of a sudden\u2026"
  - Those monsters...
  - They came out of nowhere...
  - They took my family.
  - I thought I was dreaming at first.
  - "Long claws, cold eyes\u2014like shadows that breathe. I barely made it out."
  - The Eternal Darkness... it feels alive.
  - It wraps around you, suffocating.
  - I keep hearing whispers, like they're calling for more.
  - If you decide to let anyone in, choose your visitors wisely.
  - 'One wrong choice, and you could bring trouble to the rest of us. '
  - "We can\u2019t afford more darkness."

  - But I am not one of them.

    your house."
  - "I live far from here, much farther than I ever thought I\u2019d end up."
  - "I\u2019ve been wandering for days, my feet aching, always looking over my shoulder,

    to get this far."
  - "The monsters, they\u2019ve been on my heels every step of the way. I\u2019ve
    barely slept, barely eaten."
  - "I kept telling myself, just one more step, one more day. And somehow, I\u2019m
    still here."
  - "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m lucky or cursed... but all I can do is keep moving
    and hope that maybe... just maybe... I\u2019ll find a bit of safety."
  - By the way...
