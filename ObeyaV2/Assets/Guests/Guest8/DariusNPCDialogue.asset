  aswangResponses:
  - Aswangs?
  - Sounds like something out of a fairy tale.
  - "You know, the stuff that\u2019s whispered in corners when people are too scared
    to face the truth."
  - Monsters, right? Pfft. Never met one.
  - "But if you ask me, I wouldn\u2019t want to get caught up in something like that."
  eclipseResponses:
  - Eternal Darkness?
  - That sounds like some poetic nonsense, honestly.
  - "You know, people get all dramatic about stuff they can\u2019t explain."
  - "I don\u2019t put stock in all that doom and gloom."
  - "Whatever it is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine. Nothing lasts forever, right?"
  killDialogues:
  - You'll regret this. The darkness spares no o-

  hearOutDialogues1:
  - "You\u2019re staring."
  - My arms too big for you?
  hearOutDialogues2:
  - Like what you see?
  - No?
  - Good.
  hearOutDialogues3:
  - My teeth?
  - Sharp as ever.
  - Wanna see?
  hearOutDialogues4:
  - A smile?
  - Sure.
  - "Let\u2019s pretend everything\u2019s fine, huh?"
  dialoguesNight1:

  - What a day.

  introductoryDialogue:
  - "Well, you\u2019re taking your time. I\u2019d like to come in now."
  - "Standing out here isn\u2019t exactly ideal, wouldn\u2019t you agree?"
  - "Let\u2019s skip the theatrics and get to it. Open the door, if you please."
  option1Responses:
  - "Ah, introductions. I\u2019m Darius."
  - "I don\u2019t usually have to knock this many times to be let in, mind you."
  - Now, may we continue this conversation somewhere less... exposed?
  option1_1Responses:
  - Noxus Estate, if you must know.
  - A place of comfort and, dare I say, sophistication.
  - Not that it matters now, considering the circumstances.
  option2Responses:
  - "Why shouldn\u2019t you?"
  - "I\u2019m unarmed, clearly in need, and, well, I\u2019m hardly a common thug."
  - "If you\u2019re concerned about danger, the real threat is still out there."
  - And I'll give you a handsome reward once everything is over.
  option2_1Responses:
  - Something catastrophic, obviously.
  - "Monsters roaming, the darkness all around\u2014doesn\u2019t take a genius to
    know it\u2019s bad."
  - If you let me in, perhaps I can make some arrangements when this is over.
