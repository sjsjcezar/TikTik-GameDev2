### 📜 Game Plot

An eternal eclipse has enveloped the Earth. In the chaos, some humans have turned into **aswangs**—supernatural creatures from Philippine folklore. Their origins are unknown, and they hide among the remaining survivors.

Each night, you must choose whether to **accept** or **reject** those seeking shelter. Using clues broadcast over a **radio**, you'll interrogate guests, detect lies, and manage limited energy to make life-or-death decisions.

Your ultimate goal? **Protect the innocent. Banish the wicked. Survive five harrowing nights.**
